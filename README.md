# KaggleCompMAIS202

This project was a late submission to a friendly kaggle competition with the other remaining members of the ai bootcamp, done in about 2 hours. Not my finest work and will eventually be revisited, but this was fun to do.

Using a CNN made with tensorflow, the model classifies the FASHION-MINST dataset with an accuracy of about 77%. 

To reproduce the results:
* Download the dataset in the datKaggle file and the python notebook and everything should be good to run!
